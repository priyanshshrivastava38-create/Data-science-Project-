🎯 Project Showcase: Bengaluru House Price Prediction using Data Science 🏡
Over the past few weeks, I worked on an exciting data science project focused on analyzing and predicting rental property prices in Bengaluru using Python and machine learning techniques.
🔍 Objective:
 To build a predictive model that estimates housing prices based on features like location, BHK, square footage, and number of bathrooms.
🧠 Tech Stack & Tools:
Python 🐍
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Lasso, Decision Tree)
Data Cleaning, Outlier Detection, and Feature Engineering
📊 Key Highlights:
Cleaned and processed 13,000+ records of property data.
Created new features like price per square foot for deeper insights.
Removed data outliers for accurate model performance.
Compared multiple models — achieved 84.5% accuracy with Linear Regression.
Visualized property trends and pricing differences across Bengaluru localities.
🚀 Outcome:
 Built a reliable model to predict house prices and identified how location and property features impact price.
💡 This project gave me hands-on experience in real-world data preprocessing, visualization, and model optimization — all essential steps in the data science lifecycle.
